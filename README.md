Benchmarking Against Pretrained 2D CNNs
To evaluate the performance of the custom 2D CNN model, we benchmarked it against popular pretrained architectures: DenseNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet. These models were fine-tuned on the same dataset under identical conditions.

Benchmark Models
DenseNet:

Trainable Parameters: ~7.2 million
Pretrained Weights: DenseNet Documentation
Paper: Densely Connected Convolutional Networks
